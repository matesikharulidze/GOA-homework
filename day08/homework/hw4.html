    <p>The nation of Georgia (Georgian: საქართველო sakartvelo) was first unified <br> as a kingdom under the Bagrationi dynasty by the King Bagrat III of Georgia </br>br>in the early 11th century, arising from several successor states <br>of the ancient kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia. The Kingdom of Georgia flourished during the 11th </br>and 12th centuries under rulers such as King David IV the Builder and <br> Queen Tamar the Great. The kingdom fell to the Mongol invasion by 1243, and after a restoration under George V the Brilliant </br> it fell again to the Timurid Empire in 1403. By 1490, Georgia was fragmented into several petty kingdoms and principalities, which throughout the Early Modern <br> period struggled to maintain their autonomy against Ottoman and Iranian domination until Georgia was finally annexed by the Russian Empire in the 19th century. </br>After a brief period of independence as Democratic Republic of Georgia, the country soon ended up being a Soviet Republic until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The current republic of Georgia has been independent since 1991.</p>
